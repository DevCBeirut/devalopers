                    found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.
                    He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a
                    little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and
                    divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was
                    hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any
                    moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size
                    of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.
                    "What's happened to me?" he thought.
